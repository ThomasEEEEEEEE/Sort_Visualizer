# Sort_Visualizer

This application is a sort visualizer that
can visualize 9 different popular sorts:

Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Shell Sort, Cycle Sort, and Pancake Sort.

The program features a simple 3x3 menu that allows you to
choose any one of these sorts. After seeing it visualized,
you will return to the main menu and be free to choose 
another one.
